# Omega Wallet

Omega Wallet is a fully functional crypto wallet built on the ETH blockchain with a minimalist design, allowing you to directly interact with the blockchain at **maximum** security.

The only time Omega Wallet stores your data is temporarily after importing/creating your wallet, its stored locally and the data is deleted upon page refresh.

## Get started
Click on [this](https://omegawallet.netlify.app/) to start the website.
<br>
<br>
If you already have an existing wallet, all you have to do is click on "Import Wallet" and enter your private key.
<br>
<br>
If you are new to blockchain and don't own one, or just want to create one for testing purposes, please click on "Create Wallet". You will receive a private key after creating your wallet **please** keep it somewhere safe, as you will need this key to log back into your wallet.

## Tech Stack

For the tech stack I'm using [EtherJS](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to interact with the blockchain using Javascript. The App is built on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), and I'm using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to temporarily store the data locally.
